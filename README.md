# PROTOChallenge

The PROTOChallenge is an event held by Hub Innovazione Trentino (based in Povo, Trento) which involves several teams of students gathered from the University of Trento.

To each team is assigned a different company to work with; which give out different challenges depending on the various fields of work.

In our case the team members are: Emanuele Brocchieri, Simone Carretta, Nicola Saccani, Marco Orsingher, Alice Lorenzini and Andrea Monti.

We worked with "Costruzioni Meccaniche Valentini", a leading company in the steel industry based in Roncone.

We had to optimize a mechanical linkage needed in a pusher ment to push some steel billets into an oven for a total weight of over 400'000 kg.

We managed to reduce the mass by over 44% and we decreased the components in the assembly from 18 to just 8.

Better informations can be found in the report in this repository.
